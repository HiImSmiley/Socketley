.SH DESCRIPTION
.B socketley
is a Linux-only central daemon and CLI tool for managing persistent network
runtimes (server, client, proxy, cache). It provides Docker-like management
with persistent configurations, simple CLI, and Lua scripting support.
All runtimes are managed centrally through a single daemon process, using
io_uring for high-performance async I/O.
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B daemon
Start the socketley daemon. Must be running before any other commands.
When installed system-wide, creates IPC socket at /run/socketley/socketley.sock.
In development mode, uses /tmp/socketley.sock.
On startup, restores persisted runtime configurations. Runtimes that were
running when the daemon last stopped are auto-started.
Use
.B \-\-name
and
.B \-\-cluster
to enable multi-daemon cluster discovery (see
.BR "CLUSTER MODE" ).
.TP
.BI "create " "type name " "[flags]"
Create a new runtime instance.
.I type
can be: server, client, proxy, cache.
.I name
is a unique identifier for the runtime.
.TP
.BI "attach " "type name port " "[\-\-owner " "name" "]"
Register an external process as a runtime visible in
.BR ls / ps .
The daemon does NOT bind the port or forward any I/O — the external process
manages its own network connections. The runtime appears as running and can
be inspected or removed like any other runtime.
.RS
.TP
.I type
Runtime type: server, client, proxy, or cache.
.TP
.I name
Unique name for this external runtime.
.TP
.I port
Port number the external process is listening on (informational only).
.TP
.B \-\-owner \fIname\fR
Optional owner runtime name.
.RE
.TP
.BI "start " "name|pattern" "... [\-i]"
Start one or more runtimes. Accepts multiple names, glob patterns
.RB ( * ", " ? ", " [] ),
or a mix. With
.BR * ,
starts all non-running runtimes.
.RS
.TP
.B \-i
Interactive mode. Starts the runtime and opens an interactive session.
For server: stdin is broadcast to clients, received messages appear on stdout.
For client: stdin is sent to server, received messages appear on stdout.
For cache: stdin accepts cache commands, responses appear on stdout (like redis-cli).
Not supported for proxy. Press Ctrl+C to detach (runtime continues running).
If the runtime is already running, attaches without restarting.
.RE
.TP
.BI "stop " "name|pattern" "..."
Stop one or more running runtimes. Accepts multiple names, glob patterns
.RB ( * ", " ? ", " [] ),
or a mix. With
.BR * ,
stops all running runtimes.
.TP
.BI "remove " "name|pattern" "..."
Remove one or more runtimes from the registry. Cannot be undone.
Accepts multiple names, glob patterns, or a mix. Running runtimes
are stopped first. With
.BR * ,
stops and removes all.
.TP
.BI "send " "name" " [message]"
Send a message to a running server or client runtime.
For servers, the message is broadcast to all connected clients.
For clients, the message is sent to the connected server.
Respects the runtime's mode setting (fails if mode is receive-only).
.PP
If no message is given, reads from stdin:
.nf
echo "hello" | socketley send myserver
cat data.txt | socketley send myclient
.fi
.TP
.BI "stats " "name|pattern" "..."
Display runtime statistics including total connections, messages processed,
bytes in/out, and type-specific counters. Accepts multiple names, glob
patterns, or a mix. With
.BR * ,
shows stats for all runtimes.
.TP
.BI "reload " "name|pattern" "..."
Restart one or more running runtimes (stop + start). Accepts multiple
names, glob patterns, or a mix. Non-running runtimes are skipped.
With
.BR * ,
restarts all running runtimes.
.TP
.BI "reload-lua " "name|pattern" "..."
Hot-reload the Lua script attached to one or more runtimes. The Lua
context is destroyed and re-created from the original script path.
Accepts multiple names, glob patterns, or a mix. Runtimes without
Lua scripts are skipped. With
.BR * ,
reloads Lua on all runtimes that have scripts loaded.
.TP
.BI "show " "name|pattern" "..."
Print runtime JSON configuration to stdout. Accepts multiple names,
glob patterns, or a mix. With
.BR * ,
prints all runtimes.
.TP
.BI "edit " "name " "[flags]"
Edit a runtime's configuration. When called with flags (e.g. \-p 9001),
applies changes directly like
.BR create .
When called without flags (or with only \-r/\-\-reload),
opens the runtime's JSON configuration in
.BR $VISUAL ,
.BR $EDITOR ,
or
.BR vim .
After saving, changes are validated and applied.
.TP
.BI "edit " "name " "\-r"
Interactive editor mode with auto-reload. After saving changes, the
runtime's Lua script is automatically hot-reloaded. Alias:
.BR \-\-reload .
.SS Edit: JSON Configuration Fields

.BR ls .
.TP
.BI "owner " "name"
Show ownership info for a runtime: parent name, children list, and
on_parent_stop policy (stop or remove).
.TP
.BI "cluster " "[subcommand]"
Inspect the cluster. Requires a running daemon in cluster mode
.RB ( \-\-name " + " \-\-cluster ).
The cluster directory is read from the daemon automatically.

.TP
.B watch
Continuously refresh the cluster view every 2 seconds (Ctrl+C to stop).
.RE
.TP
.BI "\-\-lua " "lua_file"
Load Lua orchestration configuration. Creates multiple runtimes from
a single config file.
.SH DAEMON FLAGS
.TP
.BI "\-\-log\-level " "level"
Set daemon log verbosity:
.B debug
,
.B info
(default),
.B warn
, or
.BR error .
.TP
.BI "\-\-name " "name" " | \-n " "name"
Name this daemon instance (required for cluster mode).
.TP
.BI "\-\-cluster " "dir"
Enable cluster mode. Each daemon publishes its runtime state to this shared
directory every 2 seconds and scans for peer daemons. Proxy
.B @group
backends automatically discover runtimes on remote daemons.
In Docker Compose, mount a shared volume at this path.
The advertised host address is set automatically via
.BR gethostname (3).
.SH COMMON FLAGS
These flags work with all runtime types:
.TP
.BI "\-p " "port"
Set listener port (server, proxy, cache) or target port (client).
.TP
.B \-s
Start immediately after creation.
.TP
.B \-\-test
Dry run. Validate configuration without starting.
.TP
.BI "\-\-log " "file"
Log state transitions (created, running, stopped, failed) to file.
.TP
.BI "\-w " "file"
Write every received message to file.
.TP
.BI "\-\-lua " "script"
Attach Lua configuration script with callbacks.
.TP
.B \-b
Output received messages to stdout (bash mode).
.TP
.B \-bp
Output messages with runtime name prefix: [name] message
.TP
.B \-bt
Output messages with timestamp: [HH:MM:SS] message
.TP
.B \-bpt
Output messages with both timestamp and prefix: [HH:MM:SS] [name] message
.TP
.BI "\-\-max\-connections " "n"
Limit maximum concurrent connections. New connections beyond this limit
are immediately closed. 0 means unlimited (default). Alias:
.BR \-\-max\-conn .
.TP
.BI "\-\-rate\-limit " "n"
Limit messages per second per connection using a token bucket algorithm.
Excess messages are silently dropped. 0 means unlimited (default).
.TP
.B \-\-drain
Enable graceful shutdown. When stopping, the runtime closes its listener
but flushes all pending write queues before closing connections.
.TP
.B \-\-tls
Enable TLS encryption for all connections. Requires
.B \-\-cert
and
.B \-\-key
for accepting runtimes (server, cache, proxy) or
.B \-\-ca
for connecting runtimes (client).
.TP
.BI "\-\-cert " "file"
Path to TLS certificate file (PEM format).
.TP
.BI "\-\-key " "file"
Path to TLS private key file (PEM format).
.TP
.BI "\-\-ca " "file"
Path to TLS CA certificate file for client verification.
.TP
.BI "\-g " "name"
.TQ
.BI "\-\-group " "name"
Assign the runtime to a named group. Groups enable dynamic proxy backend
discovery: a proxy using
.B @groupname
as a backend will route to all running members of that group at connection
time. New group members are discovered automatically without restarting
the proxy.
.SH SERVER FLAGS
.TP
.BI "\-\-mode " "mode"
Message flow direction:
.B inout
(bidirectional, default),
.B in
(receive only),
.B out
(send only),
.B master
(one client claims master, only master's messages are broadcast).
.TP
.B \-\-udp
Use UDP instead of TCP. The server binds a single SOCK_DGRAM socket.
Peers are auto-registered on first datagram. Each datagram is one message
(no line-parsing). Broadcast sends to all known peers via sendto().
Not available for cache or proxy. Incompatible with master mode.
.TP
.BI "\-\-master\-pw " "password"
Static password for master mode authentication. A client sends "master <password>"
to claim master role. Only one master at a time; master is released on disconnect.
Alternatively, use the
.B on_master_auth(client_id, password)
Lua callback for dynamic authentication.
.TP
.B \-\-master\-forward
When set in master mode, non-master client messages are forwarded to the master
as "[<fd>] <message>\\n" instead of being silently dropped.
.TP
.BI "\-\-http " "directory"
Serve static files from the given directory over HTTP. When a browser makes a
plain HTTP GET request (without a WebSocket upgrade header), the server responds
with the requested file. GET / serves index.html. HTML files (.html, .htm)
automatically get a WebSocket connection script injected before </head>.
Content-Type is detected from the file extension. WebSocket upgrades continue
to work as before on the same port. Only GET requests are served; other HTTP
methods fall through to raw TCP handling.
.TP
.B \-\-http\-cache
When used with \-\-http, reads all files into memory at startup instead of
reading from disk on each request. Faster for production. The cache is rebuilt
on
.BR reload\-lua .
Without this flag, files are read from disk on each request (suitable for
development).
.TP
.BI "\-\-cache " "name"
Link this server to an existing cache runtime. Clients can then send
"cache <command>" messages (e.g. "cache set foo bar", "cache get foo")
which are executed against the linked cache and the response returned to
the sender only. Normal messages are still processed according to the
server's mode.
.SS WebSocket Support
Servers automatically detect WebSocket upgrade requests on each connection.
When a client sends an HTTP GET with "Upgrade: websocket", the server completes
the handshake and transparently frames/deframes messages. Raw TCP and WebSocket
clients coexist on the same port. No flag is needed.
.PP
Browser example:
.nf
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:9000");
ws.onmessage = e => console.log(e.data);
ws.send("hello");
.fi
.SS Cache Access via Server
When a server is linked to a cache with
.BR \-\-cache ,
clients can send "cache <command>" messages to execute commands directly against
the linked cache. The response is sent back to the sender only (never broadcast).
Normal messages are still processed according to the server's mode.
.PP
.nf
socketley create cache store -p 9001 -s
socketley create server api -p 9000 --cache store -s
# Client sends: "cache set foo bar" → receives "ok"
# Client sends: "cache get foo" → receives "bar"
.fi
.PP
Default port: 8000
.SH CLIENT FLAGS
.TP
.BI "\-t " "host:port"
Target server to connect to. Default: 127.0.0.1:8000
.TP
.BI "\-\-mode " "mode"
Message flow direction:
.B inout
(bidirectional, default),
.B in
(receive only),
.B out
(send only).
.TP
.B \-\-udp
Use UDP instead of TCP. Creates a connected SOCK_DGRAM socket.
Each datagram is one message (no line-parsing).
Not available for cache or proxy.
.TP
.BI "\-\-reconnect " "[max\-attempts]"
Enable automatic reconnection with exponential backoff when the connection
is lost. Backoff starts at 1 second and doubles each attempt up to 30 seconds,
with random jitter. Set to 0 for infinite attempts (default when flag is given
without a value). Set to a positive number to limit reconnection attempts.
.SH PROXY FLAGS
.TP
.BI "\-\-backend " "addr"
Add backend server. Can be ip:port, runtime name, or
.BI @ groupname
to dynamically target all running members of that group. Repeatable or comma-separated.
Group backends are resolved at connection time, so new group members are picked up
automatically without restarting the proxy.
.TP
.BI "\-\-strategy " "strategy"
Load balancing strategy:
.B round-robin
(default),
.B random
,
.B lua
(custom via on_route callback).
.TP
.BI "\-\-protocol " "protocol"
.B http
(default, path-based routing) or
.B tcp
(raw byte forwarding).
.PP
Default port: 8080
.PP
HTTP mode: Requests to /<proxy-name>/* are forwarded with prefix stripped.
.SH CACHE FLAGS
.TP
.BI "\-\-persistent " "file"
Persistent storage file. Cache is saved on stop and loaded on start.
.TP
.BI "\-\-mode " "mode"
Access control mode:
.B readonly
(GET, SIZE only),
.B readwrite
(GET, SET, DEL, SIZE \- default),
.B admin
(all commands including FLUSH, LOAD).
.TP
.BI "\-\-maxmemory " "size"
Maximum memory for cache data. Supports K, M, G suffixes (e.g., 100M, 1G).
When exceeded, behavior depends on eviction policy. 0 means unlimited (default).
.TP
.BI "\-\-eviction " "policy"
Eviction policy when maxmemory is reached:
.B noeviction
(reject writes, default),
.B allkeys\-lru
(evict least recently used),
.B allkeys\-random
(evict random keys).
.TP
.B \-\-resp
Force RESP2 protocol mode for all connections (Redis wire protocol).
By default, the cache auto-detects RESP mode when a connection's first
byte is '*'. With this flag, all connections use RESP regardless.
.TP
.BI "\-\-replicate " "host:port"
Connect as a follower to the specified leader cache. The follower receives
a full data dump on connect, then receives ongoing write command replication.
The follower operates in read-only mode.
.PP
Default port: 9000

.TE
.PP
\fBon_miss\fR may return two values (Lua multi-return): the fetched string and an
optional TTL in seconds.
If the value is nil or empty, the GET returns nil to the client normally.
If a value is returned, it is inserted into the cache and returned to
the client transparently (read-through / lazy population).
.PP
\fBon_write\fR is called synchronously on the event loop thread.
For write-heavy loads, use the write-behind pattern: buffer writes in Lua
inside \fBon_write\fR and flush to the DB in \fBon_tick\fR every few seconds.
This decouples SET latency from DB latency entirely.
.PP
Example (SQLite write-behind):
.nf
tick_ms = 2000
local db, pending = nil, {}

function on_start()
    local sq = require("lsqlite3")
    db = sq.open("/tmp/cache.db")
    db:exec("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cache_kv (key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT)")
end

function on_miss(key)
    for row in db:nrows("SELECT value FROM cache_kv WHERE key=" .. db:quote(key)) do
        return row.value, 300  -- value + 300 s TTL
    end
end

function on_write(key, value, ttl)
    pending[key] = value  -- buffer
end

function on_tick(dt)
    for k, v in pairs(pending) do
        db:exec("INSERT OR REPLACE INTO cache_kv(key,value) VALUES("..db:quote(k)..","..db:quote(v)..")")
    end
    pending = {}
end

function on_delete(key)
    db:exec("DELETE FROM cache_kv WHERE key="..db:quote(key))
end

.SS Replication
Cache runtimes support leader-follower replication.
.PP
The follower connects to the leader and receives a full data dump, then
ongoing write commands are forwarded in real-time. Followers are read-only.
.PP
.nf
# Start leader cache
socketley create cache leader -p 9000 -s

# Start follower
socketley create cache follower -p 9001 --replicate 127.0.0.1:9000 -s

# Writes on leader are replicated to follower
echo "set key val" | nc localhost 9000
echo "get key" | nc localhost 9001    # Returns "val"
.fi
.PP
Example with netcat:
.nf
echo "set user:1 alice" | nc localhost 9000
echo "get user:1" | nc localhost 9000
echo "lpush queue task1" | nc localhost 9000
echo "hset user:1 name alice" | nc localhost 9000
echo "expire user:1 300" | nc localhost 9000
echo "subscribe news" | nc localhost 9000
.fi
.SH LUA CONFIGURATION
Lua scripts can define multiple runtimes and attach callbacks.
.SS Configuration File Format
.nf
runtimes = {
    { type = "server", name = "api", port = 9000, group = "api", start = true },
    { type = "client", name = "cli", port = 9000, target = "127.0.0.1:9000" },
    { type = "proxy",  name = "gw", port = 8080,
      backends = {"@api", "127.0.0.1:9000"}, strategy = "round-robin" },

}
.fi
.SS Available Callbacks
.TP
.B on_start()
Called when runtime starts.
.TP
.B on_stop()
Called when runtime stops.
.TP
.B on_message(msg)
Called when message received (server/client).
When defined on a server, this callback claims message handling: the default broadcast
(in \fBinout\fR and \fBmaster\fR modes) is suppressed. Use \fBself.broadcast(msg)\fR
to relay messages manually.
.TP
.B on_client_message(client_id, msg)
Called when message received with sender identification (server only).
Fires alongside on_message for backward compatibility.
.TP
.B on_connect(client_id)
Called when a client connects (server/client). The client_id is the file descriptor.
.TP
.B on_disconnect(client_id)
Called when a client disconnects (server/client).
.TP
.B on_send(msg)
Called when message sent.
.TP
.B on_route(method, path)
Proxy only. Custom backend selection. Returns backend index (0-based).
.TP
.B on_proxy_request(client_id, data) \(-> string | nil
Proxy only. Called for every chunk forwarded from a client to a backend.
Return a modified string to replace the data, or
.B nil
to drop the chunk entirely (the backend never receives it).
.TP
.B on_proxy_response(client_id, data) \(-> string | nil
Proxy only. Called for every chunk forwarded from a backend to a client.
Same semantics as
.BR on_proxy_request :
return a replacement string or nil to drop.
.TP
.B on_master_auth(client_id, password)
Server only (master mode). Custom authentication. Return true to grant
master role, false to deny. If defined, overrides
.BR \-\-master\-pw .
.TP
.B on_auth(client_id) \(-> bool
Server only. Called immediately after a client is accepted, before
.B on_connect
fires. Return
.B true
to admit the client or
.B false
to reject and close the connection. If the callback throws a Lua error, the client is also rejected (fail-closed). When no
.B on_auth
callback is defined, all clients are admitted.
.TP
.B on_websocket(client_id, headers)
Server only. Called immediately after a WebSocket upgrade handshake completes,
after
.B on_connect
has already fired. The
.I headers
argument is a Lua table containing any subset of the following keys from the
HTTP upgrade request:
.BR cookie ,
.BR origin ,
.BR protocol
(Sec-WebSocket-Protocol), and
.BR authorization .
Only keys present in the request are set; absent headers are nil.
This callback never fires for plain TCP clients.
.TP
.B on_tick(dt)
Called at a configurable interval while the runtime is running.
.I dt
is the actual elapsed time in milliseconds since the last tick (double).
Requires a top-level
.B tick_ms
global (integer, minimum 10, default 100 if omitted) to be set in the Lua script.
Example:
.nf
tick_ms = 50
function on_tick(dt)
    self.broadcast("ping")
end
.fi
.TP
.B on_cluster_join(daemon)
Cluster only. Called when a new remote daemon is discovered. See
.BR "Cluster Event Callbacks" .
.TP
.B on_cluster_leave(daemon)
Cluster only. Called when a remote daemon becomes stale or disappears.
.TP
.B on_group_change(group, members)
Cluster only. Called when the member count of a group changes.

.SS Global Functions
.TP
.B socketley.log(msg)
Output log message with [lua] prefix.
.TP
.B socketley.set_timeout(ms, fn)
Fire
.I fn
once after
.I ms
milliseconds using an io_uring timeout SQE.
Shares the event loop with the runtime — no extra threads.
.TP
.B socketley.set_interval(ms, fn)
Fire
.I fn
every

.TP
.B socketley.subscribe(cache_name, channel, fn)
Register
.I fn(channel, message)
to be called whenever the named cache runtime publishes to
.IR channel .
The function is called on the subscribing runtime's event loop turn (not from the cache itself).
Multiple subscriptions to the same channel are all fired in registration order.
.TP
.B socketley.http(opts) \(-> table
Synchronous HTTP/HTTPS client.
.B WARNING:
Blocks the event loop thread. Use only in
.BR on_start / on_stop
or low-frequency
.B on_tick
callbacks.
.PP
.I opts
table keys:
.nf
url         string   Request URL (http:// or https://)
method      string   HTTP method (default "GET")
body        string   Request body (optional)
headers     table    Extra headers e.g. {["Content-Type"]="application/json"}
timeout_ms  number   Timeout in milliseconds (default 5000)
.fi
.PP
Returns a table:
.nf
ok      bool    true if HTTP status 2xx
status  number  HTTP status code (e.g. 200, 404)
body    string  Response body
error   string  Error message on failure
.fi
.PP
HTTPS uses OpenSSL with
.B SSL_VERIFY_NONE
(no certificate validation) — suitable for trusted internal services.
For external HTTPS with cert validation, use
.BR "io.popen(\"curl -s ...\")" .
.SS Runtime Management API
Create, start, stop, and remove runtimes from Lua scripts:
.nf
socketley.create(type, name, config)  -- Create runtime
socketley.start(name)                 -- Start runtime
socketley.stop(name)                  -- Stop runtime
socketley.remove(name)                -- Stop + remove runtime
socketley.send(name, msg)             -- Send/broadcast to runtime
socketley.list()                      -- List all runtime names (table)
socketley.get(name)                   -- Get info table or nil
.fi
.P
Config table keys: port, config (lua script path), target, mode, group, on_parent_stop ("remove"/"stop"), start (bool).
Lua-created runtimes have parent-child ownership; port=0 creates internal-only servers that receive forwarded messages only.
.SS Cluster Introspection API
When the daemon runs in cluster mode (\fB\-\-cluster\fR), the
.B socketley.cluster
table provides read-only introspection into the full cluster topology.
All functions return empty tables when not in cluster mode, so scripts work in both standalone and cluster setups without modification.
.TP
.B socketley.cluster.daemons() \(-> table
Returns an array of daemon info tables. Each entry has:
.nf
name      string   Daemon name (from \-\-name)
host      string   Advertised address (from \-\-cluster\-addr)
runtimes  number   Count of runtimes on this daemon
.fi
.IP
The local daemon is always the first entry. Remote daemons follow in discovery order.
.TP
.B socketley.cluster.runtimes() \(-> table
Returns a flat array of all runtimes across every daemon in the cluster:
.nf
daemon       string   Name of the daemon hosting this runtime
name         string   Runtime name
type         string   "server", "client", "proxy", or "cache"
port         number   Listen port (0 = internal-only)
group        string   Group tag (empty string if unset)
state        string   "created", "running", "stopped", or "failed"
connections  number   Current connection count
.fi
.TP
.B socketley.cluster.group(name) \(-> table
Returns running members of the named group that have a valid port.
Each entry has:
.nf
daemon       string   Daemon name
host         string   Advertised address
port         number   Listen port
connections  number   Current connection count
.fi
.IP
Useful for building custom routing, health checks, or failover logic from Lua.
.TP
.B socketley.cluster.stats() \(-> table
Aggregate cluster statistics:
.nf
daemons   number   Total daemon count (local + remote)
runtimes  number   Total runtime count across all daemons
running   number   Count of runtimes in "running" state
groups    table    Maps group name (string) \(-> member count (number)
.fi
.SS Cluster Event Callbacks
These optional callbacks fire when the cluster topology changes.
Events are detected during the 2-second scan/publish cycle, so callbacks
may fire up to 2 seconds after the actual change.
A daemon is considered stale and triggers
.B on_cluster_leave
after 10 seconds without a heartbeat update.
.TP
.B on_cluster_join(daemon)
Fired when a new remote daemon is discovered in the cluster directory.
.I daemon
is a table with
.B name
(string) and
.B host
(string) fields.
.TP
.B on_cluster_leave(daemon)
Fired when a remote daemon's heartbeat file becomes stale (>10s old) or is
removed from the cluster directory.
.I daemon
is a table with a
.B name
(string) field.
.TP
.B on_group_change(group, members)
Fired when the total member count of a group changes (a runtime joins or
leaves the group, or a daemon with group members appears/disappears).
Only fires on actual count changes, not on every scan cycle.
.I group
is the group name (string).
.I members
is an array of tables, each with
.BR daemon ", " host ", and " port
fields representing the current group membership.
.PP
Example \(em log topology changes and maintain a local routing table:

.SH CLUSTER MODE
Multi-daemon cluster discovery allows proxies to route to runtimes on remote
daemons. Each daemon publishes its state to a shared directory (typically a
Docker volume) every 2 seconds. Stale entries (heartbeat older than 10s) are
automatically excluded.
.PP
.B How it works:
.RS
.IP 1. 3
Each daemon writes its state to
.IR dir / name .json
.IP 2. 3
Every 2 seconds, each daemon scans the directory for peer files
.IP 3. 3
Proxy
.B @group
resolution includes both local and remote group members
.IP 4. 3
On graceful shutdown, the daemon deletes its file

.SH STATE PERSISTENCE
Runtime configurations are persisted as JSON files. When a runtime is created,
its configuration is saved. When the daemon starts, all persisted runtimes are
restored. Runtimes that were running when the daemon stopped are auto-started.
.PP
This means runtimes survive daemon restarts and system reboots (like Docker
with restart-always policy).
.PP
State is saved after create, start, stop, remove, and edit commands.
The
.B was_running
field tracks whether a runtime should be auto-started on daemon startup.

.SS Daemon Configuration
The daemon config file is a Lua script that sets a
.B config
table:
.nf
config = {
    log_level = "info",      -- debug, info, warn, error
    metrics_port = 9100      -- Prometheus metrics HTTP endpoint
}
.fi
.PP
When
.B metrics_port
is set, the daemon starts an HTTP endpoint that serves Prometheus exposition
format metrics at
.BR "GET /metrics" .
Metrics include: runtimes total/running, connections total/active,
messages total, bytes in/out, and per-runtime breakdowns.
